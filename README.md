# Zemus

Zemus is a ruby gem that translates URLs into embedable code you can insert on a page.  It does its magic by simply inspecting and hacking up the URL itself, it makes no external requests to a webservice.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'zemus'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install zemus

## They that made the greatness

Zemus was extracted from live code running on http://cheerfulghost.com by Jon Dodson and Mark Tabler.

## Even more

Zemus was named after the antagonist of Final Fantasy IV, which is pretty neat I think.
